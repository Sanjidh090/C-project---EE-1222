Hello!
Myself Sanjid Hasan, bearing the roll 2203090.
I will be presenting our final project named "Smart BUY"
which is  a smart product managements system.
We have used file handling techniques ,array concepts, dynamic memory allocations, loops, pointers, switch case and so on that has been taught on EE 1222 course.
Here, I would like to show my project. Initially the run button or opening final.exe will do the job.
here you get 3 options, 1.order what you want
2.admin panel 3.exit.
Obviously you don't want to exit and nor you are admin so i just press 1 to order food.
here is your price list...I got the idea from python but used arrays to make it look  better. Here you can order anything you like, but choose first how many items you wanna buy....
for example. You like 5 phone,3 juice and 2 files. So, you need 3 type of items, press 3.
enter the food no. on the chart and quantity....and when you are finished.
your bill has been served. You can pay and leave.
But the game has just began..................
I am typing code bill.txt
See.........?
Here is your bill saved in bill.txt.
We can arrange pdfs if you like, but it will be at the end(if you like).

What good  a management system if owners and man with  no code can't control it?
Here we go....I am typing products.txt............
this is it. Basically it's a comma sorted values. Our program takes the data from here. A man with no prior experience can simply add or remove items name, quantity or price.
What if you need a transaction log?
We have managed to keep a system...........here are actually two ways for it.
Now I want you to run the code and enter to the admin panel. The pass word is 1222.There you'll have options to get the transaction log and edit the price list. As we used pointer here, any change will be updated to products.txt , therefore when you run the code again ,you'll have a new price list.
And now if you want pdfs ,we can arrange this too.
Type python pdf.py bill.txt EE-1222.pdf  and press enter.
type code EE-1222.pdf...................
There are all the features of our projects.
